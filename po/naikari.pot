#. -- @brief Choose an outfit from a table of outfits.
#. --
#. --    @param p Pilot to equip to.
#. --    @param set table laying out the set of outfits to equip (see below).
#. --
#. -- ``set`` is split up into sub-tables that are iterated through. These
#. -- tables include a "num" field which indicates how many of the chosen outfit
#. -- to equip before moving on to the next set; if nil, the chosen outfit will be
#. -- equipped as many times as possible. For example, if you list 3 tables with
#. -- "num" set to 2, 1, and nil respectively, two of an outfit from the first
#. -- table will be equipped, followed by one of an outfit from the second table,
#. -- and then finally all remaining slots will be filled with an outfit from the
#. -- third table.
#. --
#. -- If, rather than equipping multiples of the same outfit you would like to
#. -- select a random outfit `num` times, you can do so by setting "varied" to
#. -- true.
#. --
#. -- "probability" can be set to a table specifying the relative chance of each
#. -- outfit (keyed by name) to the other outfits. If unspecified, each outfit
#. -- will have a relative chance of 1. So for example, if the outfits are "Foo",
#. -- "Bar", and "Baz", with no "probability" table, each outfit will have a 1/3
#. -- chance of being selected; however, with this "probability" table:
#. --
#. --    probability = {["Foo"] = 6, ["Bar"] = 2}
#. --
#. -- This will lead to "Foo" having a 6/9 (2/3) chance, "Bar" will have a 2/9
#. -- chance, and "Baz" will have a 1/9 chance
#. --
#. -- Note that there should only be one type of outfit (weapons, utilities, or
#. -- structurals) in ``set``; including multiple types will prevent proper
#. -- detection of how many are needed.
#. --
#. Add entries based on "probability".
#. Starting at 2 because the first one is already in the table.

"\"It's called a skate-board,\" Flintley continues. \"The records about it "
"are a bit sketchy and a lot is nothing but conjecture, but it appears it was "
"once used in primitive communal rituals. The exact nature of these rituals "
"is unknown, but they may have been tribal initiations or even mating "
"rituals. The patterns in the board itself are thought to have a spiritual or "
"mystical meaning. Also, according to some theories, people used to stand on "
"top of the skate-board, with the cylinder wheels facing the ground. This has "
"led some historians to believe that the feet were once central to human "
"psychology.\"\n"
"\n"
"Flintley seems to have a lot more to say on the subject, but you're not that "
"interested, so you thank him and return to your ship with the ancient "

"centerpiece in my collection of relics and artifacts. Yes indeed!\n"

"anything? Well, that won't do. I'll have my assistant place a suitable "
"amount of money in your account. You will not find me ungrateful! Ah, but "
"you must excuse me. I need time to revel in this fantastic piece of art! "
"Goodbye, {player}, I will call on you when I have need of you again.\"\n"
"\n"
"You are seen out of the Baron's quarters, so you head back through the "
"airlock and back into your own ship. The first thing you do is check your "
"balance, and to your relief, it has indeed been upgraded by a substantial "

"We will therefore conduct our assault in two phases.\"\n"

"but it seems prudent to assume they will outnumber us by a fair margin. Your "
"task as auxiliary escorts is to protect the strike force's flanks and "

"the Obstinate will have limited anti-fighter armaments available, as most of "
"its hull is dedicated to fighter bays. The Obstinate must not be destroyed! "
"This is your paradigm objective!\"\n"
"    On the wall, the red dots are intercepted by the white dots, and blink "

"logos, and moves towards the glowing disc.\n"
"    \"As soon as the FLF have exhausted their forces trying to "
"counterattack, the HDSF Obstinate will begin launching bombers. It is our "

#. Drinking Aristocrat
#. Author: geekt
#. Idea from todo list.
#.
#. An aristocrat wants a specific drink which he recalls from a certain planet and will pay handsomely if you bring it. When you get to said planet it turns out the drink isn't served there but the bartender gives you a hint. You are then hinted until you end up getting the drink and bringing it back.
#.
#. Thank you to Bobbens, Deiz, BTAxis, and others that have helped me with learning to use Lua and debugging my scripts in the IRC channel. Thanks as well to all those that have contributed to Naev and made it as great as it is today, and continue to make it better every day.

"deal to bundle our engines, they created their own Remige Engines. We still "

"can't go unpunished. I've got money, I'm willing to pay. All you need to do "

"a moment. Nobody would be reckless enough to alter their own scores that "
"way, so the only reason my scores would have been altered is if someone else "
"did it, no doubt in order to discredit me. And you guessed it, the prime "
"suspect was Harja. After all, if I was disqualified, he would certainly have "

"his low attempt to secure his own success.\"\n"
"    \"That's basically the history between me and Harja. Up until you came "

#. * They are run in a shared state. All global variables will be the same for all outfits of the same type.
#. * You can use the 'mem' table to access memory for the particular outfit being used.

#. The init is run when the pilot is created
#. The update function is run periodically every 1/3 seconds
#. 'dt' is the time elapsed since last time run in seconds

#. This is especially useful for outfits that can't be toggled, but want to

#. armour is the amount of armour damage taken (in MJ)

#. Rescue script for stranded pilots.
#.
#. The basic structure is as follows:
#.
#. If the player lacks any core outfits, either:
#.
#. a) The ship's defaults are added to the empty slots
#. b) All cores are replaced with the ship's defaults
#.
#. If that fails, then the player is presented with various options:
#.
#. a) Remove all non-cores
#. b) Remove weapons, utility, or structure outfits separately
#. b) Replace cores with defaults
#.
#. There is no failure mode beyond this, as a ship that isn't spaceworthy
#. in its default state already generates warnings on load.
#.
#. This script has two known flaws at the moment. Players aren't considered
#. stranded if the outfitter sells outfits that can fill all missing slots,
#. or replace existing cores. This is done without regard to affordability.
#.
#. The second is that some conditions (e.g. free cargo space) are independent
#. of outfits, and because we don't explicitly check them, fall-through to the
#. final "this is a bug, please report" happens more than it ought to.

#. player can afford, the player is not considered stranded.

#. From there, it gets decidedly more complex. An outfit pool is created,
#. consisting of the player's inventory, plus:
#.
#. a) If the planet has a shipyard, the player's other ships' outfits
#. b) If the planet has an outfitter, the outfitter's stock
#.
#. At this point, the player is only stranded under two circumstances:
#.
#. 1) They're missing core outfits and nothing in the pool fits.
#. 2) The ship is bare aside from core outfits, yet isn't spaceworthy
#. and no other suitable core outfits are available.
